title: API # make sure to match the name of the system in the config file

On top of defining a description for each system, you can also create a page for each system. This is useful if you want to add more information about the system, such as a link to the documentation, or a list of affected components.

This page is optional, but if you do not create one, the status page will not show the system in the summary.
